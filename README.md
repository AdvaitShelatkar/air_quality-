## Key Deliverables
### 1.   Data Cleaning and Preparation  
- Processed raw air quality datasets from multiple sources.  
- Addressed missing data and anomalies to ensure reliable insights.  

### 2.   Visualizations  
-   Temporal Trends  : Line charts showcasing air quality trends over time.  
-   Geographical Analysis  : Heatmaps identifying regions with the highest pollution levels.  
-   Pollutant Comparison  : Bar charts comparing levels of different pollutants.  
-   Correlation Analysis  : Scatter plots examining relationships between pollutants and meteorological factors like temperature and humidity.  

### 3.   Insights  
-   Seasonal Variations  : Higher pollution levels observed during winter months due to increased heating activities.  
-   Hotspots  : Urban areas with high traffic and industrial activity are major pollution contributors.  
-   Correlation  : Strong correlation between particulate matter (PM2.5) and NO2 levels in densely populated regions.  
-   Call to Action  : Emphasized the need for stricter emission controls and public awareness programs in pollution hotspots.
